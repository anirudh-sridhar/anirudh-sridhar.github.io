I am a postdoctoral associate at the Mathematics Department at MIT, working with [Elchanan Mossel](https://math.mit.edu/~elmos/). Previously, I was a PhD candidate at Princeton's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/) and [Vince Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor). My research uses tools from probability, statistics and graph theory to tackle fundamental challenges in network analysis, causal inference and epidemiology.
