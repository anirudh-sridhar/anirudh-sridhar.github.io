I am a postdoctoral associate at the Mathematics Department at MIT, working with [Elchanan Mossel](https://math.mit.edu/~elmos/). Previously, I completed my PhD at Princeton's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/) and [Vince Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor). My research uses tools from probability, statistics and graph theory to tackle fundamental challenges in network analysis, causal inference and epidemiology. Recent and ongoing research directions include:
- **Graph Matching.** How can structural similarities be found across networks, and what can we learn from the commonalities?  My research characterizes the precise information-theoretic thresholds for the possibility or impossibility of this question and related ones, such as community detection or clustering.
- **Modeling network cascades.** How does a cascading process -- such as misinformation in social networks, malware in computer networks, or a virus in a human population -- evolve over time? And how does the evolution depend on viral mutations, mitigation measures, and the interactions between individuals? I tackle this question from various angles, highlighting the interplay between network topology and cascade characteristics. 
- **Inference and Mitigation of network cascades.** The rapid spread of the coronavirus underscored a need to develop more sophisticated techniques for learning about new pathogens and tracking their spread *before* they cause too much damage. My research establishes fundamental, data-driven solutions to these challenges, with a focus on information-theoretic characterizations.
