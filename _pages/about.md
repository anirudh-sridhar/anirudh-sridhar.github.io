I am a postdoctoral associate at the Mathematics Department at MIT, working with [Elchanan Mossel](https://math.mit.edu/~elmos/). Previously, I completed my PhD at Princeton's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/) and [Vince Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor). My research uses tools from probability, statistics and graph theory to tackle fundamental challenges in network analysis, causal inference and epidemiology. Recent and ongoing research directions include:
- **Graph Matching.** How can structural similarities be found across networks, and what can we learn from the commonalities?  My research characterizes the precise information-theoretic thresholds for the possibility or impossibility of this question and related ones, such as community detection or clustering.
- **Modeling and mitigation of network cascades.** How does a cascading process -- such as misinformation in social networks, malware in computer networks, or a virus in a human population -- evolve over time? And how can we learn about the ongoing spread *before* such cascades cause too much damage to society at large? My research develops the underlying theory behind new aspects of cascade models (e.g., viral mutations, mask-wearing) and designs novel statistical methods for learning about cascades.
