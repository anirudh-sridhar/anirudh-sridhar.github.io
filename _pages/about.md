Since Fall 2025, I have been an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). At NJIT, I am also affiliated with the [Elisha Legal Bar-Ness Center for Machine Intelligence, Signal Processing and Communications (MICS)](https://research.njit.edu/cwcspr/) as well as the [Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://research.njit.edu/cams/).


Previously, I worked with [Elchanan Mossel](https://math.mit.edu/~elmos/) as a postdoctoral associate at MIT's Math department. Before that, I completed my PhD at Princeton's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/) and [Vince Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor). My research uses tools from probability, statistics and graph theory to tackle fundamental challenges in network analysis, causal inference and dynamical systems.

**Openings for students are available. If you have a strong mathematical background and are interested in working in my group, please [apply to our PhD program](https://www.njit.edu/admissions/phd-programs) and reach out to me via email.**

**Upcoming talks:** Rutgers CS Theory Seminar (Feb 18), American Control Conference (May), International Workshop in Sequential Methodologies (June)
